Let's create a simple example using Express.js to demonstrate how you can implement Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) using middleware for a basic web application scenario.

Admin: Has full CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) access to all resources.
User: Has read and update access to their own resources.
